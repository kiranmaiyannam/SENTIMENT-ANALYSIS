# DESCRIPTION
This project demonstrates how to perform Sentiment Analysis on customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify text reviews as either positive or negative, based on the underlying sentiment. This task was completed as part of the internship assignment from CodTech.

Using TF-IDF vectorization, we convert the textual data into numerical features, and then apply a Logistic Regression model to classify the sentiment. The project also includes evaluation of the model performance and visualization of results.

# Key Features
Clean and preprocess raw text data
Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer
Build a Logistic Regression model for classification
Evaluate model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Visualize predictions and performance metrics

 # Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Confusion Matrix
