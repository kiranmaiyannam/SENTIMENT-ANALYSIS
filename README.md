# DESCRIPTION
This project demonstrates how to perform Sentiment Analysis on customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify text reviews as either positive or negative, based on the underlying sentiment. This task was completed as part of the internship assignment from CodTech.

Using TF-IDF vectorization, we convert the textual data into numerical features, and then apply a Logistic Regression model to classify the sentiment. The project also includes evaluation of the model performance and visualization of results.

# Key Features
